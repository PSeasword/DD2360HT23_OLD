# Exercise 2 - 2D Dense Matrix Multiplication

To run NVIDIA Nsight, run the scripts

```
nsight_128x128_128x128.sh
nsight_511x1023_1023x4094.sh
```

for A (128x128) and B (128x128), and  A (511x1023) and B (1023x4094), respectively. To obtain data for further matrix sizes, run

```
furtherMatrixSizes.sh
```

and then

```
plotFurtherMatrixSizes.py
```

to plot a stacked bar chart of the collected data.
