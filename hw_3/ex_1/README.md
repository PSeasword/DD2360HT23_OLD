# Exercise 1 - Your First CUDA Program and GPU Performance Metrics

To run NVIDIA Nsight, run the scripts

```
./nsight1024.sh
./nsight131070.sh
```

with vector lengths 1024 and 131070, respectively. To obtain data for further vector lengths, run

```
./furtherVectorLengths.sh
```

and then

```
./plotFurtherVectorLengths.py
```

to plot a stacked bar chart of the collected data.
